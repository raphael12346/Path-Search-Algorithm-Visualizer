## Path Search Algorithm Visualizer Documentation

### Overview

This Python Tkinter application visualizes path searching algorithms on a weighted graph. The user can specify the start and goal nodes, choose a searching algorithm (BFS, DFS, Hill Climbing, Beam Search), and observe the traversal process on the graph.

### Usage

1. Run the script (searchVisualizer.py).
2. Enter the start and goal nodes in the provided Entry widgets.
3. Choose a searching algorithm (BFS, DFS, Hill Climbing, Beam Search).
4. Adjust the simulation speed using the Scale widget.
5. Click the "Pause" button to toggle between pause and play states during the visualization.
6. Observe the changes in the graph as the algorithm traverses through the nodes.
